The coursework was given as part of a second year mathematics module. It was undertaken in collaboration with 4 teammates.

The analysis methods were implemented via Matlab. A final report was submitted detailing the analyses. The report was written in LaTeX. Overleaf was utilised to collaborate on the document online.

The team achieved an A* through a comprehensive report.

The tasks involved analysis of ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations. The mathematical problems were placed in the context of electrical engineering applications, and the interpretations of the results obtained were related to their real world implications. The 4 main exercises in the report revolved around RL circuits, error analysis, RLC circuits and diffusion of heat along a wire.
